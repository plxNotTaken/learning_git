/* cloning a repository */

-> git clone http://github.com/example.git (* clones into example *)
-> git clone http://github.com/example.git my_folder (* clones into my_folder *)

3 steps in git clone:
  1. downloads entire repo into a new directory
  2. adds origin remote poiting to the clone URL
  3. checks out initial branch (usually master)

/* Creating a branch */

-> git branch buggy
-> git checkout buggy (* switches to buggy branch *)
-> git checkout -b buggy (* creates buggy brunch and switches to it at same time *)
-> git add file.txt
-> git commit -m "file.txt"

/* Merging branches */

-> git checkout master (* switch to branch we want to merge into *)
-> git merge buggy (* merge buggy branch into master branch *)
-> git branch -d buggy (* delete buggy branch *)
